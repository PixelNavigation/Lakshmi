# ðŸŽ¤ OmniDimension Web Widget Integration Complete!

## âœ… Integration Summary

I've successfully integrated the OmniDimension web widget into your Lakshmi Trading Platform. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Widget Script Integration**
- Added the OmniDimension widget script to your Next.js layout:
```html
<script 
  id="omnidimension-web-widget" 
  async 
  src="https://backend.omnidim.io/web_widget.js?secret_key=c8a4cf53b530546eb57899fecd0e1dcb"
></script>
```

### 2. **Smart Widget Component** (`src/Components/OmniDimensionWidget.js`)
- Created a React component that configures the widget based on user authentication
- Automatically passes user context (ID, email, name, auth token) to the widget
- Shows/hides widget based on login status
- Configures voice command context for trading platform

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to `.env.local` for client-side widget access
- Widget can now make authenticated API calls to your trading platform

### 4. **Authentication Integration**
- Widget automatically receives user authentication token
- All voice commands will be executed as the authenticated user
- Real portfolio, balance, and trading data access

## ðŸŽ¤ Voice Commands Now Available

Users can now use voice commands like:

### **Portfolio & Balance**
- "Show my portfolio"
- "What's my balance?"
- "How much cash do I have?"

### **Trading Commands**
- "Buy 5 shares of TCS"
- "Sell 10 shares of Reliance" 
- "Purchase 20 shares of Infosys"
- "Dispose 3 shares of HDFC Bank"

### **Stock Research**
- "Search for Tata Consultancy Services"
- "Find information about Reliance"
- "Look up HDFC Bank stock"

### **Watchlist Management**
- "Add TCS to my watchlist"
- "Remove Reliance from watchlist"
