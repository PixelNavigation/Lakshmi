# 🎉 OmniDimension Integration Authorization Fix - COMPLETE!

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The authorization issue with your OmniDimension widget has been **completely fixed**! 

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified
The APIs were working perfectly, but there was a **response format mismatch**:
- OmniDimension expected: `{success: true, data: {inr_balance: 19379.91}}`
- Our APIs returned: `{success: true, balances: {inr: 19379.91}}`

### 🛠️ Fixes Applied

#### 1. **API Response Format Updates**
- ✅ **Balance API** (`/api/user-balance`) - Now returns both formats:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "inr_balance": 19379.91,
      "eth_balance": 0
    },
    "balances": {
      "inr": 19379.91,
      "eth": 0
    }
  }
  ```

- ✅ **Portfolio API** (`/api/user-portfolio`) - Now returns both formats:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": [...portfolio holdings...],
    "portfolio": [...portfolio holdings...]
  }
  ```

#### 2. **OmniDimension Widget Configuration**
- ✅ Enhanced `OmniDimensionWidget.js` with:
  - Proper authentication headers in endpoint configuration
  - Better error handling and debugging
  - Automatic retry mechanisms for widget loading

#### 3. **Authentication Flow**
- ✅ **Perfect Authentication**: APIs receive and validate Bearer tokens correctly
- ✅ **User Context**: OmniDimension gets proper user ID, email, and auth token
- ✅ **Header Configuration**: All API calls include proper Authorization headers

## 📊 Test Results
